                        Feathers provides a lot of the things that you need for building modern web and mobile
                        applications. Here are some
                        of the things that you get out of the box with Feathers. All of them are optional so you can
                        choose exactly what
                        you need. No more, no less. We like to think of Feathers as a
                        <span class="italic">"batteries included but easily swappable"</span> framework.

                            <td><strong>Instant REST APIs</strong></td>
                            <td>Feathers automatically provides REST APIs for all your services. This industry best
                                practice makes it easy
                                for mobile applications, a web front-end and other developers to communicate with your
                                application.

                            <td>With Feathers service adapters you can connect to all of the most popular databases, and
                                query them with a
                                unified interface no matter which one you use. This makes it easy to swap databases and
                                use entirely different
                                DBs in the same app without changing your application code.

                            <td>Feathers services can notify clients when something has been created, updated or
                                removed. To get even better
                                performance, you can communicate with your services through websockets, by sending and
                                receiving data directly.

                            <td>Using "hooks" you have an extremely flexible way to share common functionality or <a

                                Keeping with the Unix philosophy, these hooks are small functions that do one
                                thing and are easily tested but can be chained to create complex processes.

                            <td>Services and hooks are a powerful and flexible way to build full stack applications. In
                                addition to the server,
                                these constructs also work incredibly well on the client. That's why Feathers works the
                                same in NodeJS, the
                                browser and React Native.

                            <td>Almost every app needs authentication so Feathers comes with support for email/password,
                                OAuth and Token (JWT)
                                authentication out of the box.

                                at once. Therefore, Feathers gives you pagination for every service from the start.

                                errors, including validation errors, and return them to the client in an easily
                                consumable format.
